Combinatory Circuits
1. Binary adders with parallel structure

1.1 Half Adder
To show the operation of a multi-bit adder, we will start with the simplest form, which is a half-adder (Half Adder).

Run and test the operation of the following circuit. Place the results in the appropriate table. What functions do the S and C outputs fulfill?

1.2 Full Adder
Extend the previous circuit with a second similar one so that you can add two bit variables to each other, taking into account what is created on the previous adder. Explain the function of the C input.
Test the circuit and place the results in the appropriate table.

1.3 Implementation of the full adder module (macro)

Check the operation of the implemented scheme, whether it is the same as the previous one. Place the results in the appropriate table.

1.4 Three-bit adder

Implement the circuit as shown in the figure below. Prove with several examples that the circuit works correctly as a 3-bit adder. Place the results in the report.

Sequential Circuits

2.2 Synchronous decimal counter
Test the operation of a synchronous decimal counter built based on the 74192 circuit - this is a synchronous, reversible BCD decimal counter with two clock inputs and zeroing.

Present the results and a description of the problem in the report.
